    "## openai.ChatCompletion\n",
    "    It is a function from the OpenAI library that allows one to interact with AI models for generating conversational text. It helps in creating chat-like responses based on the given input prompts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    !pip install openai==0.28.1\n",

    "    \n",
    "### There are 3 roles:\n",
    "#### System: \n",
    "        This sets the behaviour and tone of the AI, providing context on how it should respond throughout the conversation. We defined 2 system inputs in a list named 'systems' according to the education level. One is used for foundational to secondary levels and other is used for UG and PG.\n",
    "#### User: \n",
    "        This represents the input or messages from the person interacting with the AI, asking questions or giving instructions. User input prompt is defined for all the levels as a list named 'prompts' with questions and answers.\n",
    "#### Assistant: \n",
    "        This signifies the AI's responses, generated based on the system instructions and user input.\n",
    "### Hyperparameters that are used to fine tuning:\n",
    "#### Temperature: \n",
    "    This setting controls the randomness of the AI's responses; lower values result in more predictable responses, while higher values lead to more creative and varied replies. [0,2]\n",
    "#### Frequency penalty: \n",
    "    This reduces the likelihood of the AI repeating the same words or phrases in its responses, promoting more diverse output. [0,2]\n",
    "#### Presence penalty: \n",
    "    This discourages the AI from mentioning the same topics repeatedly, encouraging it to introduce new ideas or subjects in the conversation. [0,2]\n",
    "#### Seed: \n",
    "    It is a starting value used to initialize a random number generator. It determines the sequence of random numbers that the generator produces. Providing the same seed ensures that the sequence of random numbers is reproducible.\n",
    "#### max_tokens:\n",
    "    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We have defined different hyperparameters for each level in a list containing tuples of parameters.\n",
    "    [(temperature1, frequency_penalty1, presence_penalty1), (temperature2, frequency_penalty2, presence_penalty2)]\n"

    "    None: Returns None if an exception occurs during the API call.\n",

    "    [name, gender, current_class, age, current_city, target_education, UG/PG, target_country]\n",
    "##### Returns:\n",
    "    Now, we check the l[2] i.e., current_class and returns a list as [prompt_index, system_index] based on the current_class level.\n",
    "    prompt_index : the prompts list has 6 indices 0-5 per level.\n",
    "    system_index : the systems list has 2 indices 0 and 1; 0 for foundation to secondary and 1 for UG and PG.\n",
    "    Example if a student is studying 3rd class i.e., preparatory level, the function returns [1,0] (retrieves prompts[1] and systems[0]) whereas if a student is studying UG-2nd year i.e., UG level, the function returns [4, 1] (retrieves prompts[4] and systems[1])."
